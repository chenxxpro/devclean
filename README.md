> Scans development directories and explains which folders are likely safe to delete — and why.

**devclean** is a scan-only CLI tool that analyzes development directories and helps you understand **what can probably be removed**, without ever deleting files itself.

It is designed for:

* Multi-language projects
* Monorepos
* Inherited or unfamiliar codebases
* Developers who prefer certainty over automation

> **Scan-only. It never deletes files.**

---

## Why devclean exists

Every developer has faced this situation:

* A project directory is taking tens of gigabytes
* You see folders like `target/`, `build/`, `dist/`, `node_modules/`
* You *think* they are safe to delete — but you are not fully sure

The problem is not deletion.
The problem is **confidence**.

devclean exists to answer one question:

> **“Can I safely remove this — and why?”**

---

## What devclean does

devclean analyzes a directory and reports:

* Detected project ecosystems (Rust, Node.js, Python, Java, …)
* Known build artifacts and generated directories
* Clear explanations for *why* a directory is considered removable
* A qualitative confidence level for each result

devclean focuses on **explainability over automation**.

---

## What devclean does NOT do

To set expectations clearly:

* ❌ It does not delete files or directories
* ❌ It does not modify your filesystem
* ❌ It does not run cleanup commands
* ❌ It is not a system-wide cleaner

All actions remain **explicit and user-controlled**.

---

## Suggested Cleanup Commands (No Deletion Performed)

devclean is **scan-only by design**.
It never deletes files or directories.

Instead, devclean provides **explicit, copy-paste-ready cleanup commands** that you may choose to run yourself.

This design ensures:

* You stay in full control
* No accidental data loss
* Clear responsibility boundaries

---

### How suggested commands work

For each detected directory, devclean may provide a **Suggested command** when the confidence is sufficiently high.

These commands are:

* **Never executed automatically**
* **Explicit and familiar**
* **Chosen to match the detected ecosystem when possible**

Example output:

```text
Directory: target/
Type: Rust build artifacts
Confidence: HIGH

Why:
- Generated by cargo during compilation
- Safe to regenerate at any time
- Commonly excluded from version control

Suggested command:
  cargo clean
```

You decide **if**, **when**, and **whether** to run the command.

### Ecosystem-native commands first

Whenever possible, devclean prefers **ecosystem-native cleanup commands** over raw file deletion.

| Ecosystem | Preferred suggestion                 |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Rust      | `cargo clean`                        |
| Node.js   | `rm -rf node_modules && npm install` |
| Java      | `mvn clean` / `gradle clean`         |
| Python    | Standard cache cleanup patterns      |

Using native tools:

* Matches developer expectations
* Handles edge cases better
* Reduces risk compared to manual deletion

---

### Confidence-based behavior

devclean only suggests commands when it has **sufficient confidence**.

* **HIGH confidence**
  → A suggested command is provided

* **MEDIUM confidence**
  → A command may be provided with caveats

* **LOW confidence**
  → No command is suggested
  → Manual review is recommended

Example:

```text
Directory: build/
Type: Unknown output
Confidence: LOW

Why:
- Directory name matches common build patterns
- No toolchain detected
- May contain manually generated files

Suggested action:
  Review contents manually before deletion
```

## Installation

> ⚠️ Early-stage project. Interfaces may change.

```bash
cargo install devclean
```

---

## Usage

```bash
devclean scan .
```

Optional flags:

```bash
devclean scan . --format=json
devclean scan . --confidence=high
```

---

## Design philosophy

devclean follows a few strict principles:

* **Explainability over automation**
* **Safety over convenience**
* **Explicit actions over implicit behavior**

> devclean explains.
> You decide.
> Nothing is removed without your action.
