## 📌 Maintainer note (please keep)

* This project intentionally avoids feature creep at this stage.
* We prioritize issues that reveal:

  1. Real hesitation and fear of deletion
  2. Incorrect or missing rule detection
  3. Explanations that fail to build trust

> A single real-world “I wasn’t sure if I could delete this” story is more valuable than ten feature requests.
